# 🧠 LeetCode Practice

Hey there! 👋
This repo is where I dump all my **LeetCode** solutions while I practice coding problems — mostly in **Python**, sometimes in other languages when I feel like switching it up.

The main goal here is simple:
👉 **get better at problem solving**
👉 **prepare for interviews**
👉 **and have fun learning along the way**

## 🗂️ Folder Structure

I try to keep things somewhat organized (keyword: *try* 😅):

```
📂 LeetCode/
 ├── Easy/
 │   ├── two_sum.py
 │   ├── valid_parentheses.py
 ├── Medium/
 │   ├── longest_substring.py
 └── Hard/
     ├── merge_k_sorted_lists.py
```

Each file usually includes:

* a short description of the problem
* my thought process / approach
* time & space complexity
* code (with some comments if I remembered 😆)

---

## 🧩 Topics

I’ll be covering stuff like:

* Arrays & Strings
* Linked Lists
* Stacks & Queues
* Trees & Graphs
* Dynamic Programming
* Recursion & Backtracking
* Sorting & Searching
* Bit Manipulation

Basically… all the usual LeetCode pain points 😂

## ⚙️ How to Run

Most of the code is in Python 3.
You can just run any file with:

```bash
python3 problem_name.py
```

---

## 🚀 Goals

* Solve a few problems every week (consistency > speed)
* Improve on old solutions
* Add explanations that my future self can actually understand
* Maybe track my progress over time

---

## 🧾 Notes

Everything here is **for learning purposes only**.
All problems belong to [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), but the code and explanations are mine.
